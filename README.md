# Pilot Preflight IMSAFE Checklist 
# Jaylene Baltazar, Hunter Banks, Colin McClelland

### What the project does:
This project centers around an IMSAFE checklist for pilot pre-flight routines, IMSAFE 
stands for illness, medication, stress, alcohol, fatigue, and emotion. The app will
walk users through a survey and store the responses so pilots will be able to see what
their answers were, what the regulations are, and also seek mental and physical resources in a 
separate page on the app.
This will require the use of SQLite, which appears to be covered within the scope of this class. 
However, this will be combined with the use of API calls to find nearby Aviation Medical Examiner’s, 
or possibly calculating an individual's BAC percentage, and displaying the weather. While we don't 
The FAA does publish the list of AME’s along with their location, so it seems possible to use tools 
such as ‘Retrofit’ to convert this web page to a JSON object for our API response.

### Why the project is useful:
This project is useful for pilots making both personal and commercial flights. Currently, 
the flying community doesn't have a preflight IMSAFE checklist that will walk them through
the rules and give safety tip reminders. By implementing this app, safety and corresponding precautions
will improve, especially since many aviation non-profit organizations, such as the Aircraft 
Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA), emphasize the importance of evaluating mental and 
physical health, as several incidents occur each year due to pilot neglect.



### How users can get started with the project:

Installing the Pilot Preflight App:
Begin by cloning the Pilot Preflight app from the project repository into Android Studio.

Launch the App:
Once cloned, run the Pilot Preflight app on your computer, phone or tablet. 
The app can be run with the Android emulator or via an Android mobile device if applicable.

If on a tablet or andriod phone, users can click into the pilot preflight app, identifiable by the associated airplane logo and app name, on the home page. Once open, the user will be presented with the app's homescreen and can click through all functionalities.


### Where users can get help with your project: 
Instructions on how to use the Pilot Preflight app are provided within the application via text descriptions.

Project documentation is provided in the deliverables which are available through this repository.

### Who maintains and contributes to the project:
For the duration of Professor Olivares' app development group project, that maintenance and developments of this 
IMSAFE project pre-flight will be managed by Jaylene, Hunter, and Colin. Since the project is a cumulative assignment
for this class, the updates won't be continued after completion. Each group member will have an essential role in 
ensuring the functionality of the app, including addressing any issues that arise during testing and evaluations.
