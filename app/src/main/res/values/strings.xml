    <string name="regulations_text"> The IMSAFE checklist helps pilots and co-pilots determine if they are fit to fly. It is critically important that every pilot conduct a personal pre-flight health assessment before piloting any aircraft.

    There are myriad physiological and psychological factors that could impair a pilot’s ability and render a flight unsafe. The IMSAFE checklist ensures pilots meet the standards in Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 67 before any flight.

    IMSAFE stands for:
    Illness:Do you have current or recent illnesses that could affect flight?
        Medication: Have you been taking any meds that could impair your ability to fly?
        Stress: Are you experiencing unusual psychological pressure and/or anxiety?
        Alcohol: Have you had any alcohol in the last eight hours? Are you hungover?
        Fatigue: Are you tired and/or not adequately rested?
        Emotion: Are you emotionally upset about anything?
