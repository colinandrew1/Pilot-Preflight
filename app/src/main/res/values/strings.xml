    The IMSAFE checklist helps pilots and co-pilots determine if they are fit to fly. It is critically important that every pilot conduct a personal pre-flight health assessment before piloting any aircraft.

    There are myriad physiological and psychological factors that could impair a pilotâ€™s ability and render a flight unsafe. The IMSAFE checklist ensures pilots meet the standards in Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 67 before any flight.

    <b>IMSAFE stands for:</b>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Illness:</b> Do you have current or recent illnesses that could affect flight?</li>
        <li><b>Medication:</b> Have you been taking any meds that could impair your ability to fly?</li>
        <li><b>Stress:</b> Are you experiencing unusual psychological pressure and/or anxiety?</li>
        <li><b>Alcohol:</b> Have you had any alcohol in the last eight hours? Are you hungover?</li>
        <li><b>Fatigue:</b> Are you tired and/or not adequately rested?</li>
        <li><b>Emotion:</b> Are you emotionally upset about anything?</li>
    </ol>
